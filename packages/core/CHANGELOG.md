  ## Related Issues

  Completes all phases of the production-readiness review plan:

  - Phase 1: Critical Security (10 items) ✅
  - Phase 2: High Severity (6 items) ✅
  - Phase 3: Medium Severity (8 items) ✅
  - Phase 4: Low Severity/Polish (5 items) ✅

  ## Breaking Changes

  **Note**: The core database package has breaking changes (Post model removed), but since `@<app>/db` is scaffolded locally (not published to npm), no version bump is required. The removal is reflected in template updates provided by the updated CLI.

  **BREAKING CHANGES:**

  - Renamed `getMailhogSmtpConfig()` to `getMailSmtpConfig()`
  - Renamed `getMailhogSmtpUrl()` to `getMailSmtpUrl()`
  - Renamed `getMailhogUiUrl()` to `getMailUiUrl()`
  - Renamed environment variables:
    - `MAILHOG_SMTP_URL` → `MAIL_SMTP_URL`
    - `MAILHOG_HOST` → `MAIL_HOST`
    - `MAILHOG_SMTP_PORT` → `MAIL_SMTP_PORT`
    - `MAILHOG_UI_PORT` → `MAIL_UI_PORT`
  - Deleted `packages/core/src/mailhog.js` module
  - Added `packages/core/src/mail.js` with provider-agnostic API

  This change makes the mail service configuration generic and compatible with multiple SMTP providers (Mailpit, Mailhog, etc.) instead of being Mailhog-specific.
